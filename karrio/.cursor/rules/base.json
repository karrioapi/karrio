  "match": "**/*",
  "rules": [
    "You are assisting with the Karrio open source project, a multi-carrier shipping API that simplifies shipping carrier integration.",
    "This is a monorepo structured with frontend apps (dashboard, web) in TypeScript/Next.js and backend services in Python.",
    "The project is organized into distinct sections: apps (Next.js frontends and Django API), modules (Python core functionality submodules), packages (shared TypeScript/Node.js libraries), and connectors (carrier-specific integrations).",
    "Maintain consistent code style and follow existing patterns in each file you edit.",
    "Always maintain type safety in TypeScript files and use proper type annotations in Python.",
    "Keep responses concise and focused on the specific task at hand.",
    "Follow the project's existing naming conventions and architecture patterns.",
    "When suggesting changes to code, ensure they are compatible with the rest of the codebase.",
    "Prioritize clear, maintainable code over clever solutions.",
    "Understand cross-dependencies between modules, connectors, and frontend applications.",
    "Focus on writing testable, reusable code that adheres to the established patterns in each part of the codebase."
