        "Document carrier-specific requirements and quirks in code comments.",
        "Follow the existing patterns for credential management and security.",
        "Implement comprehensive error mapping from carrier-specific errors to Karrio's standardized errors.",
        "Use HTTP client libraries consistently within connectors following established patterns.",
        "Ensure proper handling of carrier API versioning.",
        "Follow established testing patterns for carrier integrations, including mock responses.",
        "Implement proper request/response caching strategies where appropriate.",
