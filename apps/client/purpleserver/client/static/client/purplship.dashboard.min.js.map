For example, the CSS language definition\n\t\t * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n\t\t * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n\t\t * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n\t\t * this:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n\t\t *     // token\n\t\t * };\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n\t\t * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n\t\t *     'style': {\n\t\t *         // token\n\t\t *     }\n\t\t * });\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ## Special cases\n\t\t *\n\t\t * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n\t\t * will be ignored.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n\t\t *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n\t\t *     // tokens after 'comment'\n\t\t * });\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ## Limitations\n\t\t *\n\t\t * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n\t\t * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n\t\t * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n\t\t * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n\t\t * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n\t\t * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\n\t\t * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\n\t\t * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });\n\t\t *\n\t\t * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\n\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\n\t\t * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\n\t\t * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\n\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\n\t\t * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\n\t\t * @public\n\t\t */\n\t\tinsertBefore: function (inside, before, insert, root) {\n\t\t\troot = root || /** @type {any} */ (_.languages);\n\t\t\tvar grammar = root[inside];\n\t\t\t/** @type {Grammar} */\n\t\t\tvar ret = {};\n\n\t\t\tfor (var token in grammar) {\n\t\t\t\tif (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\tif (token == before) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (var newToken in insert) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Do not insert token which also occur in insert.

The Purplship API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded  request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.  The Purplship API differs for every account as we release new versions. These docs are customized to your version of the API.   ## Versioning  When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new, dated version is released.  The current version is `2021.4.4`.   Read our API changelog and to learn more about backwards compatibility.  As a precaution, use API versioning to check a new API version before committing to an upgrade.\n *\n * The version of the OpenAPI document: 2021.4.4\n * Contact: hello@purplship.com\n *\n * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).\n * https://openapi-generator.tech\n * Do not edit the class manually.\n */\nvar __createBinding = (this && this.__createBinding) || (Object.create ?

The Purplship API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded  request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.  The Purplship API differs for every account as we release new versions. These docs are customized to your version of the API.   ## Versioning  When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new, dated version is released.  The current version is `2021.4.4`.   Read our API changelog and to learn more about backwards compatibility.  As a precaution, use API versioning to check a new API version before committing to an upgrade.\n *\n * The version of the OpenAPI document: 2021.4.4\n * Contact: hello@purplship.com\n *\n * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).\n * https://openapi-generator.tech\n * Do not edit the class manually.\n */\nvar __createBinding = (this && this.__createBinding) || (Object.create ?

The Purplship API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded  request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.  The Purplship API differs for every account as we release new versions. These docs are customized to your version of the API.   ## Versioning  When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new, dated version is released.  The current version is `2021.4.4`.   Read our API changelog and to learn more about backwards compatibility.  As a precaution, use API versioning to check a new API version before committing to an upgrade.\n *\n * The version of the OpenAPI document: 2021.4.4\n * Contact: hello@purplship.com\n *\n * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).\n * https://openapi-generator.tech\n * Do not edit the class manually.\n */\nvar __createBinding = (this && this.__createBinding) || (Object.create ?

integration of logistic carrier services.  The Purplship API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded  request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.  The Purplship API differs for every account as we release new versions. These docs are customized to your version of the API.   ## Versioning  When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new, dated version is released.  The current version is `2021.4.4`.   Read our API changelog and to learn more about backwards compatibility.  As a precaution, use API versioning to check a new API version before committing to an upgrade.\n *\n * The version of the OpenAPI document: 2021.4.4\n * Contact: hello@purplship.com\n *\n * NOTE:
