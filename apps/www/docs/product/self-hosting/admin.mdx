title: Instance settings
---

When self-hosting Karrio there are several instance settings that can be adjusted according to your needs.
These settings are available on the admin console. Some settings can only be set using Environment variables.

Instance settings can be managed by staff users by visiting the Instance settings page (api.instance.com/admin).
Some setting configurations cannot be managed this way, and in particular,
settings that determine how Karrio should behave at runtime must be set using Environment variables.
Please review the Environment variables list for further details.

## Updating settings

Settings can easily be updated from Karrio's admin console.
When updating, settings are applied immediately and used across your entire instance.
The settings updated here can be for advanced users and may have adverse consequences to your instance when not managed properly.
Please review any warnings or additional information carefully that comes up when updating settings.

## Staff users

Staff users are a special kind of instance-level permission that allows managing advanced instance-wide settings.
A user can be a staff user regardless of their permission level to any organization(s) in your instance.
Only staff users can manage these settings.

The first user in any instance is a staff user. This user can then add others if applicable.
When possible, it is recommended to have multiple staff users to ensure your instance can always be properly maintained.

Staff users can also easily manage (add/remove) other staff users via the Karrio user interface or the API.
You can visit the Instance status (/admin/) page and navigate to the "Users" section to do this.

If you don't have any staff users, you can add your first staff user, by connecting to your instance, and then running the commands below.

```terminal
karrio shell
```

Once you access the karrio (Django) interactive shell,

```python
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
user = get_user_model().objects.get(email="email_of_the_user_to_add@example.com")
user.is_staff = True
user.save()
```

## Configuring email

Karrio's core relies on email messaging for certain functionality. For example:

- Sending a reset link to a user that has forgotten their password.
- Sending an invite link for new team members to join Karrio.

By default, Karrio will not send email messages until you enable an SMTP server.
We very strongly recommend using an email service to act as email server.
Choose a provider that is optimized to maximize email deliverability.

To prevent spam, most email providers have very complex systems in place
that validate a myriad of factors before allowing an email through.
Optimizing local servers for this is a bit like reinventing the wheel,
so avoid this unless you have a very strong reason not to.

### Environment config

To configure a remote email server, you will need to head over to Instance settings and set up the following parameters:

- `EMAIL_HOST`: Defaults to None. Hostname to connect to for establishing SMTP connections.
- `EMAIL_PORT`: Defaults to 25. Port that should be used to connect to the host.
- `EMAIL_HOST_USER`: Defaults to null. Credentials to connect to the host.
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`: Defaults to null. Credentials to connect to the host.
- `EMAIL_USE_TLS`: Defaults to false. Whether to use TLS protocol when connecting to the host.
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`: Defaults to noreply@example.com. Email address that will appear as the sender in emails (From header).
- `EMAIL_ENABLED`: Defaults to true. Whether email service is enabled or not.

## Configuration data retention

You can setup karrio instance to automatically delete data after a certain period of time.

- `ORDER_DATA_RETENTION` : Defaults to `183`. Number of days to keep order data.
- `TRACKER_DATA_RETENTION` : Defaults to `183`. Number of days to keep tracker data.
- `SHIPMENT_DATA_RETENTION` : Defaults to `183`. Number of days to keep shipment data.
- `API_LOGS_DATA_RETENTION` : Defaults to `92`. Number of days to keep API logs and SDK tracing data.

### Data archiving schedule

- `DATA_ARCHIVING_SCHEDULE` : Defaults to every `168` hours (7 days). Cron schedule for data archiving.
