## Overview

karrio proposes a set of unified APIs accepting all required data to send requests to the supported carrier services.

The typical data flows for all requests processed by karrio is illustrated bellow.

        participant API
        participant Mapper
        participant Proxy
        participant Carrier as Carrier webservice

        Note over API: Unified Datatypes
        Note over Carrier: Carrier webservice

        Proxy->>Carrier: HTTP Request
        Carrier-->>Proxy: HTTP Response
        Proxy-->>Mapper: Deserializable<br/>Carrier specific response<br/>(JSON, XML, ...)
        Mapper-->>API: Parsed unified response data
        API-->>User: JSON data
    `}

/>

To accomplish this, the overall abstraction proposed by karrio come down to the implementation these abstract classes.

### The `Settings`

:::info
The `Settings` class defines all the carrier specific credential required to authenticate connections
and additionally

-   a unique `carrier_name` (a readonly name. e.g: canadapost)
-   a unique `carrier_id` (a nickname provided for each instance. e.g: canadapost_test_account)
-   optionally an `account_country_code` (a country specific account number)
-   optionally a unique `id` reference in your system or a database
    :::

### The `Mapper`

:::info
The `Mapper` class translates the unified karrio API data into carrier specific data to send requests
and also takes care or parsing the response returned back into a unified data model

:::

### The `Proxy`

:::info
The `Proxy` class defines one or many HTTP requests required to communicate with a carrier service

[Learn more about the Proxy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern)
:::

## In practice

This is how these classes come together to make a request to a carrier service

````python
from karrio.mappers.canadapost import Settings, Mapper, Proxy

# Instantiate a connection settings
canadapost_settings = Settings(
    username="username",
    password="password",
    customer_number="2004381",
    contract_id="42708517",
)

# Instantiate the carrier corresponding translator
canadapost_mapper = Mapper(canadapost_settings)

# And finally the carrier corresponding communication proxy
canadapost_proxy = Proxy(canadapost_settings)


# e.g: a Pickup scheduling request
from karrio.core.models import PickupRequest, Address


# A karrio unified Pickup request type
pickup_request: PickupRequest = PickupRequest(
    pickup_date="2021-12-15",
    ready_time="10:00",
    closing_time="17:00",
    address=Address(
        postal_code="V6M2V9",
        city="Vancouver",
        country_code="CA",
        state_code="BC",
        address_line1="5840 Oak St"
    )
)

# Convert into a carrier specific pickup request
canadapost_pickup_request = canadapost_mapper.create_pickup_request(pickup_request)

# Send the request the carrier
canadapost_pickup_response = canadapost_proxy.schedule_pickup(canadapost_pickup_request)

# Parse the response into a karrio unified Pickup response type
pickup_response = canadapost_mapper.parse_pickup_response(canadapost_pickup_response)

print(pickup_response)
```shell
(
    PickupDetails(
        carrier_name='canadapost',
        carrier_id='canadapost',
        confirmation_number='0074698052',
        pickup_charge=ChargeDetails(
            name='Pickup fees',
            amount=4.42,
            currency='CAD'
        )
    ),
    [] # message and error list here
)
````

:::info
The example above illustrates a Pickup scheduling but the idea is that all requests made by karrio follow the same lifecycle:

-   convert unified karrio API data into a carrier specific request using the `Mapper`
-   send the request to the carrier using the `Proxy`
-   and parse back the response into a unified karrio data using the `Mapper`
    :::

:::caution
Note that karrio does not raise exceptions when there is a failure during requests but rather always return
a tuple of a `response` if `successful` with a list of `messages` if any **notes**, **messages** or **errors**
in case of `failures` are returned.
:::

## Fluent API

Once you understand the lifecycle above, you can send any requests supported by karrio with the same mental model.
However, this looks a little verbose. That's why we introduced a Fluent interface to handle this process with fewer lines.

```python
import karrio.sdk as karrio

# Create a carrier connection gateway
# This will instantiate the corresponding Settings, Mapper and Proxy
canadapost_gateway = karrio.gateway['canadapost'].create({
    'contract_id': '42708517',
    'customer_number': '2004381',
    'password': 'password',
    'username': 'username'
})

pickup_request = karrio.Pickup.schedule({
    'pickup_date': '2021-12-15',
    'closing_time': '17:00',
    'ready_time': '10:00',
    'address': {
        'address_line1': '5840 Oak St',
        'city': 'Vancouver',
        'country_code': 'CA',
        'postal_code': 'V6M2V9',
        'residential': False,
        'state_code': 'BC'
    }
})

pickup_response = pickup_request.with_(canadapost_gateway).parse()
```

:::info
Note the concept of Gateway introduced here to encapsulate the access to the external system that are carrier servers
in our case.
