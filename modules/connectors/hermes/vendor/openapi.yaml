  description: |-
    This is the order API of the Hermes Shipping Interface.

    <details>
      <summary>Note on Unicode support</summary>

      The API accepts UTF-8 encoded request bodies, but only a fraction of all possible
      [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) characters.

      Only characters from the following [Unicode blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_block) of
      the [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane)
      are supported:

      - [Basic Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Latin_(Unicode_block)) <sup>1</sup>
      - [Latin-1 Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement) <sup>2</sup>
      - [Latin Extended-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-A) <sup>3</sup>
      - [Latin Extended-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-B) <sup>3</sup>

      Characters from other Unicode planes are not supported and will result in 400 Bad Request.

      <sup>1</sup> except for [C0 control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C0_controls) and
      the **␡** character (0x004F).

      <sup>2</sup> except for [C1 control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C1_controls) and
      any character from the [general category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#General_Category) Symbol.

      <summary>Note on User Agent header</summary>

      By providing an application specific [User Agent](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-14.43), you help us to identify
      your application that is making the API call. This makes troubleshooting more effectively and faster as we can identify your requests more easily.
