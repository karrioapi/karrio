Seeds and seedlings of coffee, shrubs. Used consumer goods (See Observation #5 for exception).</Prohibitions>
    <Restrictions>Medicines must be accompanied by a prescription from the attendant Brazilian doctor. This prescription should be on a chemist's form, bearing the name, private address or office of the doctor, his registration number with the Brazil National Medical Council and a Portuguese translation of the instructions, as necessary. Postal packages containing medicaments and not satisfying the above-mentioned conditions will be returned to the senders or, if abandoned, treated as undeliverable items. Postage stamps are admitted only in registered First-Class Package International Service with Registered Mail service shipments. Saccharine and other artificial sweeteners for artificial beverages require permission from the Brazilian Department of Public Health for importation.</Restrictions>
    <Observations>1. Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Tel√©grafos (ECT) is introducing a "Fee for Postal Dispatch" with a current value of 15 Brazilian reals (BRL) for items presented to customs. If the addressee has not properly paid this fee, ECT will return the item to the sender. 2. Import licenses are required for many kinds of goods. ECT recommends that the sender ascertain from the addressee before mailing that the addressee holds the necessary documents. A shipment that does not have a required import permit is subject to confiscation as contraband. 3. The mailer must affix all necessary or relevant documents including invoices, export/import licenses, certificates of origin, health certificates, etc., to the outside of the item. 4. Imports are allowed by mail, including mail order catalog shipments, up to a value of U.S. $500 (U.S. $1,000 for computer software) without the requirement of an import license provided the item is not for resale. Shipments valued at no more than U.S. $50 are duty-free and are delivered to the addressee; shipments above U.S. $50 can be picked up at the post office upon payment of import duties. Imports that are prohibited or subject to special regulations must comply with applicable Brazilian government provisions. Identical shipments from the same source to the same person or address in Brazil within a 90-day period are considered part of the same shipment and may be subject to confiscation. Other merchandise that usually enters duty-free include items such as newspapers, maps, books, and magazines. 5. The mailer must fully and accurately complete the customs declarations, including the landline or mobile telephone number of the addressee, if available, and detailed information concerning the contents and value of the item, such as branded product description, model, serial number, and value of each individual article within the item. ECT immediately returns to the sender an item that does not have a properly completed customs declaration. 6. The importer tax identification (ID) number is required for all items containing goods. In Brazil, the importer tax ID number is known as "CPF" (format: 000.000.000-00) for natural persons and as "CNPJ" (format: 00.000.000/0000-00) for legal persons. This information must be provided either by the mailer in the importer reference field of the customs declaration form or on the commercial invoice, or by the importer through the Correios website at www2.correios.com.br/sistemas/rastreamento. 7. Shipments that do not indicate the applicable postage and fees on PS Form 2976-A will hinder the customs clearance process, causing delays to clear the items. 8. Used consumer goods may only be sent to charitable organizations that are recognized by the Brazilian government as being entities which serve the public interest.</Observations>
