All alcoholic beverages including wines, etc. An issue of a publication that contains an advertisement primarily directed to a Canadian market is a prohibited import if that advertisement does not appear in identical form in all editions of the issue distributed in the country of origin. Articles so marked as to create the false impression that they were made in Canada, Great Britain or any other British country. Commercial tags of metal. Firearms, except as follows: Firearms may be mailed to Canada if the importer has the required documentation and if the firearms meet the requirements in Publication 52, subchapter 43 and part 632. Before mailing, customers must visit cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/import/iefw-iefa-eng.html to review Canadian import requirements. Gold bullion, gold dust, and nonmanufactured precious metals. Non-refillable lighters or any other lighter that contains fuel. New lighters with no fuel may be sent. Oleomargarine and other butter substitutes, including altered or renovated butter.

Vaping liquids containing 66 mg/g or more nicotine by weight. Note: The U.S. Postal Service measures the concentration of nicotine solutions by volume rather than by weight, so it is possible that a product that does not exceed Canada's weight restriction would exceed the Postal Service's volume restriction. Nicotine solutions with a concentration of 16.67 percent (166 mg/ml) or more, when nicotine is the only toxic material in the liquid, are classified as "dangerous goods" (see 136.1) and as such are prohibited in international mail.

    <Observations>1. As noted in the Prohibitions section, Canada prohibits certain vaping products. However, vaping products, otherwise known as electronic smoking products (i.e., electronic products for the vaporization and administration of inhaled doses of nicotine including electronic cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and pipes, as well as cartridges of nicotine solutions and related products), that make health claims are subject to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act (FDA). "Health claims" refers to any statement that represents the product as a drug or device under section 2 of the FDA - for example, a statement that the product will help someone quit smoking. Vaping products that make health claims require authorization under the FDA before being commercially imported, advertised, or sold in Canada. A vaping product that makes health claims is considered a prescription drug, and before importation to Canada, it requires a Drug Establishment License and an assigned corresponding Drug Identification Number (DIN). For more information, visit canada.ca/en/health-canada/topics/licensing-authorizing-manufacturing-drug-health-products.html. Vaping products with no health claims and no drugs other than nicotine are not subject to the FDA. 2.
