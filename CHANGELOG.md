I am particularly excited about karrio built-in automation. The vision is to simplify syncing data between karrio and other platforms.
I have been asked for integrations with platforms such as Shopify, Woocommerce, Commercetools and various ERP systems to sync orders and relevant data across the systems. With karrio built-in automation, I hope to tackle that with the least amount of work.

Shout out to Fadi owner at [Shipr](https://www.shipr.com.au/) as we collaborate to make Karrio a turnkey solution for 3PLs and logistics providers.
With this, they will be able to deploy their dedicated shipping platform, automate shipping but, also empower their merchants and customers with their own workspace and API access. In addition to our API and Webhook, it will be even easier to integrate karrio and build your custom shipping tech stack.

-   Improve custom carrier label management
-   Provide default order and shipment dates
-   Fix tracker `in_transit` status inconsistency
-   Introduce Sentry support for Karrio dashboard error tracking and APM" "Purplship Shipping Platform Edition 2022.2

## Road to cloud beta

-   Consolidate email flows for operations that require confirmations
-   Consolidate organization and team management (`insiders`)
-   Organization members listing and invitation
-   Organization ownership transfer
-   Organization creation
-   Setup foundations for oauth2 and apps integration (beta) (`insiders`)
-   Implement Webhook secret header for event origin signature validation
-   Integrate One-call shipment label purchase
-   Automate incremental tracking_number generation for customs carrier labels
-   Order management update (`insiders`)
-   Introduce `shipping_from` for orginin address prefill
-   Rename `shipping_address` to `shipping_to`

## Breaking changes

-   **The GraphQL API queries and mutations have been enhanced and some renamed for consistency.**
    **We highly recommend using the same version on the server and dashboard**

-   **Introduce `docs: Documents = JStruct[Documents, REQUIRED]` to `ShipmentDetails`**

_The implied the removal of the `label: str` field from the root of `ShipmentDetails` to `ShipmentDetails.docs.label`_

Proxy API `POST /v1/proxy/shiping` now returns as `docs` object with `label` base64 string and optionally an `invoice` base64 string

API `Shipment` object now returns

-   `label_url`: URL to the purchase shipment label
-   `invoice_url`: URL to the purchase shipment invoice when supported

API `Shipment` deprecated data

-   `label` field has been deprecated and removed in order to optimize shipments database queries and size
-   `shipment.meta.invoice` field has been deprecated and removed for optimization as well

**As a result of this change, shipments requests are less heavy and faster**

## Bugs

-   Inconsistent Charfield validation caused validity pre-request and failure to persist carrier API changes to the database.

## Docker builds

Current release `2022.2` - `danh91.docker.scarf.sh/purplship/server:2022.2`
" "Purplship Shipping Platform Edition 2022.1

## What's New

-   Introduce label template configuration and custom label generation
-   Introduce support adding user metadata to purplship objects (`Order`, `Tracker`, `Commodity`, `Shipment`...)

## Breaking changes

_The Shipping REST APIs are focused on automation and single requests to perform shipping operations. The GraphQL API on the other hand powers manual operations from the dashboard with multiple mutations of shipping objects._

For that reason

-   The following endpoints have been removed
-   `/v1/shipments/<id>/options` to update/add shipment options
-   `/v1/shipments/<id>/customs` to add shipment customs declaration
-   `/v1/shipments/<id>/parcels` to add shipment parcels

_There has been many breaking changes on mutations and queries on the GraphQL API so we recommend checking out the [2022.1.4 purplship dashboard release](https://github.com/purplship/purplship-dashboard/releases/tag/v2022.1)_
