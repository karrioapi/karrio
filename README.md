puprlship is a modern development kit that simplifies the integration of shipping carriers services into an app.

The key features are:

- **Unified API**: A standardized set of models representing the common shipping data (`Address`, `Parcel`, `Shipment`...)
- **Intuitive API**: A library that abstracts and unifies the typical shipping API services (`Rating`, `Shipping`, `Tracking`...) 
- **Multi-carrier**: Integrate purplship once and connect to multiple shipping carrier APIs
- **Custom carrier**: A framework to integrate a shipping carrier services within hours instead of months


*For a complete shipping management REST API with a dashboard checkout [purplship-server](https://github.com/purplship/purplship-server).*

from purplship.core.models import Address, Parcel, RateRequest
from purplship.mappers.canadapost.settings import Settings


# Initialize a carrier gateway
canadapost = purplship.gateway["canadapost"].create(
    Settings(
        username="username",
        password="password",
        customer_number="123456789",
        test=True
    )
)

# Fetching shipment rates

# Provide the shipper's address
shipper = Address(
    postal_code="V6M2V9",
    city="Vancouver",
    country_code="CA",
    state_code="BC",
    address_line1="5840 Oak St"

    city="Moncton",
    country_code="CA",
    state_code="NB",
    residential=False,
    address_line1="125 Church St"

# Specify your package dimensions and weight
parcel = Parcel(
    height=3.0,
    length=6.0,
    width=3.0,
    weight=0.5,
    weight_unit='KG',
    dimension_unit='CM'
)

# Prepare a rate request
rate_request = RateRequest(
    shipper=shipper,
    recipient=recipient,
    parcels=[parcel],
)

# Send a rate request using a carrier gateway
response = purplship.Rating.fetch(rate_request).from_(canadapost)

# Parse the returned response
rates, messages = response.parse()

print(rates)
# [
#     RateDetails(
#         carrier_name="canadapost",
