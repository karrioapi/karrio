        "Karrio uses a modular architecture where core functionality is divided into focused Python modules.",
        "Each module should have a clear single responsibility and well-defined interfaces.",
        "Follow the existing module structure and organization patterns.",
        "Use relative imports within the same module and absolute imports across different modules.",
        "Implement proper error handling and propagation between modules.",
        "Keep modules loosely coupled to facilitate testing and maintainability.",
        "Ensure each module has appropriate unit tests covering core functionality.",
        "Follow the factory pattern for service creation where applicable.",
        "Use dependency injection to manage module dependencies.",
        "Document module interfaces thoroughly with clear usage examples.",
        "Maintain backward compatibility when making changes to module interfaces.",
        "Avoid circular dependencies between modules.",
        "Implement clean module boundaries with well-defined public APIs.",
        "Use descriptive, domain-specific naming for module components.",
        "Follow the established error handling patterns for each module type."
